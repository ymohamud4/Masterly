# Masterly
A social platform for learning and teaching real-world skills

Project Overview
Masterly is a web-based platform designed to connect people who want to teach or learn real-world skills. The platform will allow users to create profiles, book one-on-one or group sessions, and showcase their expertise. The goal is to democratize access to mentorship and skill development while enabling individuals to earn income by teaching what they know.

Step-by-Step Plan
Step 1: Ideation & Planning
Define key user types: Learners & Instructors.

Identify MVP features and functionalities.

Sketch low-fidelity wireframes (Figma or hand-drawn).

Document core workflows (booking, messaging, payments).

Step 2: Frontend Development
Set up frontend with React and Tailwind CSS.

Build reusable UI components:

Navigation bar

Profile cards

Booking calendar

Search/filter section

Set up routing with React Router.

Step 3: Backend Development
Choose between Node.js + Express or Firebase.

Set up user authentication with Firebase Auth.

Create database schema or Firestore collections:

Users

Sessions

Reviews

Messages

Enable file uploads for profile pictures and project portfolios.

Step 4: Payment Integration
Integrate Stripe to allow instructors to:

Set custom prices

Receive payments directly

Implement transaction records and security handling.

Step 5: Messaging & Communication
Build real-time messaging using Firebase Realtime DB or Socket.IO.

Allow session-based communication between learners and instructors.

Step 6: Visual Components
User dashboards for tracking:

Upcoming lessons

Earnings/spending

Ratings/reviews

Public leaderboards and "Top Sessions of the Week".

Step 7: Deployment
Host frontend on Vercel or Netlify.

Deploy backend on Firebase Functions or Render.

Ensure all endpoints and data connections are secured.
