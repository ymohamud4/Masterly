# Masterly


Project Overview
This project aims to develop Masterly, a social platform where users can teach or learn real-world skills. The application will allow professionals and hobbyists to create instructor profiles, set their own prices, and offer sessions in areas like design, trades, art, coding, and more. Learners will be able to search for instructors, book sessions, communicate directly, and leave feedback. The goal is to give skilled individuals a way to earn income through teaching, while helping others grow through mentorship and flexible learning.

Step-by-Step Plan
Step 1: Planning & Research
Define project goals and scope. Research similar platforms like Skillshare and Wyzant to identify strengths and areas for improvement. Outline user roles and features.

Key Outputs:

MVP feature list

Wireframes or UI sketches

Target audience definition

Tech stack planning

Step 2: Frontend Development
Set up the frontend using React and Tailwind CSS. Create key user interface components for both learners and instructors.

Core UI Components:

Homepage with skill categories

User sign-up/login page

Instructor profile page

Booking interface

Messaging system layout

Ratings & review section

Step 3: Backend Development
Develop backend logic with Node.js + Express or Firebase Functions. Create endpoints to handle user authentication, bookings, reviews, and chat messages. Connect to a cloud-based NoSQL database like Firestore or MongoDB Atlas.

Key Backend Features:

User authentication and session management

CRUD operations for bookings and reviews

Secure chat system with real-time updates

Stripe integration for payments

Step 4: Payment System Integration
Use Stripe API to implement a payment system that allows instructors to:

Set their hourly/session rate

Receive payments directly

View earnings dashboard

Securely manage transaction history and user billing.

Step 5: Visualizing Platform Data
Enable instructors to view their teaching statistics and earnings trends. Add visual insights for learners on skills learned or time invested.

Types of Charts:

Bar charts showing instructor earnings over time

Pie charts for learner time allocation per skill

Line graphs for weekly or monthly session trends

Step 6: Deployment
Use Vercel or Netlify to host the frontend and Firebase Functions or Render for backend deployment. Ensure the platform is responsive and mobile-friendly.
